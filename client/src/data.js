      "My name is Corinne St. Martin and I am the founder of the WWCH and Wyatts mom. Losing my son was an unimaginable loss that I will never get over. Losing my lifelong partner in such a short time after was devastating and left me feeling lost. I knew I wanted to create a space in honour of my son and my husband where people could gather and connect on a spiritual level while we all learn to navigate this human life. I found so much healing in art through my grief journey and I hope to bring that practice to others who may need it.",

      "My name is Kalita Wiebe and I am the co-founder of the WWCH and Wyatt's sister. Losing Wyatt and my dad so close together was a major turning point in my life. This incredible loss gave me the motivation to delve more into holistic healing and begin my journey as a herbalist and nutritionist. I'm currently a certified holistic nutritionist and a student at Pacific Rim College where I am getting a dual diploma in Holistic Nutrition and Phytotherapy. My goal is to work with others to help create sustainable, long-lasting changes for their overall health and wellbeing.",

      "I am very excited to partner with the WWCH to offer life coaching services at the centre - Coaches create a safe, non-judgmental, objective space where clients are seen as whole and complete and supported and encouraged on their journey to living their best lives. I have a diverse professional and personal background that gives me a depth of empathy and understanding that I bring to client sessions, with the only agenda being the well-being of my clients and a focus on their desired outcomes. Through curious exploration I help my clients gain new insights and awareness that inspire them to maximize their potential; ultimately leading clients to life-changing discoveries while the coach is there to help identify successes and celebrate them with you. I was fortunate enough to know and love Wyatt while he was alive, and through my coaching practice, I continue his legacy of helping others and supporting them on their life's journey. Still not sure what a life coach can offer? Book a complimentary Discovery Call today to see if coaching is a good fit for you! I look forward to connecting with you soon.",

      "Raised in the small town of Legal, Alberta, I was surrounded by the values of integrity, hard work, and resilience. I grew up with a love for horses; when my dad brought home our first horse, \"Valley,\" I was hooked. Along came 4-H and Teen Time, which only deepened my passion. I've dedicated my recent career to working with at-risk youth and children with varying abilities. As an Educational Assistant, I provide emotional support in inclusive settings, helping students manage aggressive, depressive, and destructive behaviors. I've also worked closely with families as a Family Support Worker, providing respite care, home support, assistance with community outings, and teaching life skills to clients. In 2009, I founded my Equine Assisted Learning company. I offer a range of workshops, including women's workshops, youth programs, corporate team-building, and family coaching.",
