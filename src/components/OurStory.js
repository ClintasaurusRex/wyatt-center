            Our mission is to offer this land in service to our community with love and gratitude to
            honour those before us and those who will come after. We wish to bring a sense of
            community, connection, and healing.

          <h1>Our Why</h1>
          <p>
            After the sudden passing of our founders son, Wyatt, in January of 2021, it was clear
            she wanted to do something to honour him. A short four and a half months later her
            husband Ed passed away and the tragic event solidified her need to honour their legacy.
            After only a few months the idea of the Wyatt Wiebe Centre for Healing came to be. She
            knew she wanted to create a space of love, compassion, and healing for anyone and
            everyone who needed it. Everyone who knew Wyatt knew he was such a lively, caring, and
            outgoing person who could make anyone feel welcome and uplifted and that is what we hope
            to do here at the centre.
